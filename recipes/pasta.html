        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This baked chicken and bacon pasta in creamy sauce is a weeknight meal that's simple to put together and can be customized. Want it to be spicy? Swap out the seasoning. Want a different pasta? It can be swapped out, too.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces penne pasta</li>
            <li>3 ounces pork shoulder bacon, cut into strips</li>
            <li>12 ounces chicken breast meat, cubed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>2 ounces shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until fat has rendered, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove bacon to a plate to cool.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Add chicken to the same skillet; stir in Italian seasoning and black pepper. Cook and stir until chicken is golden, about 5 minutes; remove from heat. Chop bacon and add to the skillet.</li>
            <li>Melt butter In a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour until smooth and golden. Pour in milk, whisking constantly. Stir in mozzarella cheese and Gruyere cheese; cook until cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta. Pour cheese sauce over pasta; stir in chicken and bacon. Pour mixture into a casserole dish</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until bubbly, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
